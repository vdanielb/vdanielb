ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @vdanielb  
I'm a student at UC San Diego, interested in databases, machine learning, statistics, and data science. 
- I'm currently working on E4E's Acoustic Species ID project. We're creating a desktop app for audio data annotation to use for our animal identification ML model. I primarily work on database management and crafting SQL queries. 
- I'm also a Data Science tutor for UCSD. I've tutored for DSC10 and DSC30.
- As a recipient of the HDSI Undergraduate Scholarship, I'll also be working with Data Science Alliance to create a Food Rescue Routing & Impact Tracker this academic year.
